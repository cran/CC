Description: Tools for creating and visualizing statistical process control charts. Control charts are used for monitoring measurement processes, such as those occurring in manufacturing.  The objective is to monitor the history of such processes and flag outlying measurements: out-of-control signals.  Montgomery, D. (2009, ISBN:978-0-470-16992-6) contains an extensive discussion of the methodology.
